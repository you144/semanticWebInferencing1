 * A wrapper around the underlying stream that prevents the underlying stream from being closed (if passed to other methods that are not very nice and close
 * your stream). The initial motivation for this wrapper was ZipOutputStream where you write into multiple separate entries; some methods (which are not aware
 * that they write to a ZipOutputStream) when they finish writing their _data they close the stream, which terminates the whole process of producing the zip
 * file.

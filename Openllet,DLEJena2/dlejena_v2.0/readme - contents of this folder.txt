The examples here can be compiled and run using:
_run_ApacheMavenMultipleJars.bat
_run_ApacheMavenSingleJar.bat
_run_manualJarChoice.bat

Each _run_... batch file writes the outputs to the respective output_... folder

They use the jars in the respective lib\... folder

They use data from the data or dataFromJevan folders

The source code is in the examples or examplesModifiedByJevan folders

You can look at the outputs that are already there from when I ran it.

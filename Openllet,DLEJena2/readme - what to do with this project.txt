------------------------------------------------------------

The aim of this particular folder is to get the dlejena2 and openllet 2.6.2 examples to compile
and run successfully using java without an IDE.

1. Read openllet 2.6.2\readme - contents of this folder.txt

Then do whatever you want to do in the "openllet 2.6.2" folder

2. Read dlejena_v2.0\readme - contents of this folder.txt

Then do whatever you want to do in the "dlejena_v2.0" folder

3. The folders "openllet maven" and "dlejena maven" are available if you want to
try and regenerate the single intellij maven jar

4. Presently this project is not working from java 
in the folders "openllet 2.6.2" and "dlejena_v2.0"
and I don't know how to fix it. Any ideas?
